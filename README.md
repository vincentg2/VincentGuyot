# Vincent Guyot, Welcome to my GitHub page !

I am a french student fullstack Javascript Developper.
I am currently studying @ Ecole O'clock, and i'm enjoying it ! 

Studying, learning, fixing bugs is now a part of my journey.
I'm actually more focused on developping my Front skills with the ecosystem React,
And I'm really interested getting experience with Vue.js, typescript and Three.js also.
